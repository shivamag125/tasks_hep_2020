Task1: 
ML task:
Imrovement techniques used:
1. Reduced overfitting with dropouts
2. Reduced overfitting by ignoring the last feature column
3. Normalize data


Further improvements:
1. Better hyperparameter(learning rate) search techniques can be employed.
2. Use ensemble of models
3. More data, more features may improve results
